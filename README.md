# 📞 Telecom Customer Churn Prediction  
### End-to-End MLOps Project using DVC, MLflow, Streamlit & Docker

This project is a **production-grade Machine Learning system** that predicts **telecom customer churn** using a fully reproducible **ML pipeline** built with **DVC**, tracked using **MLflow**, and deployed as an interactive **Streamlit web application**.

It demonstrates **real-world MLOps practices** such as data versioning, pipeline automation, experiment tracking, and model deployment.

## 📦 Important Note on DVC, MLflow & Artifacts

This project was **originally developed as a fully automated DVC pipeline**, covering:

- Data ingestion  
- Data preprocessing & feature engineering  
- Model training  
- Model evaluation  

### 🔹 Role of Tools
- **DVC** → Manages datasets, pipeline stages, and reproducibility  
- **MLflow** → Tracks experiments, parameters, metrics, and model versions  

> **In short:**  
> 🧠 DVC manages the pipeline → 📊 MLflow tracks experiments → 🌐 Streamlit deploys the model → 🗂️ GitHub hosts final artifacts
